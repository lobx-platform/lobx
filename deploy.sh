# Pull the backend image directly rather than via `docker compose pull`.

# On the deployment host `docker` is the podman compatibility shim, but
# `docker compose` hands off to a separate, real Compose binary. The two do not
# share a credential store: a `docker login` is recorded where podman keeps its
# credentials, while the external Compose binary looks for a Docker-style
# config.json and finds nothing. A registry that needs authentication therefore
# fails under `compose pull` even directly after a successful login.
#
# `docker pull` stays inside the shim, so it uses the credentials the login
# actually wrote. Compose then finds the image already present locally and does
# not need to pull it itself.
